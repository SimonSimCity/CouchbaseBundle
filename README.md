CouchbaseBundle
===============

Adds two Symfony commands to make it easier to automate import and export of design documents, stored in couchbase.

The installation for this bundle is like any other.

After installing this bundle, you'll see two new methods in your symfony console:

* couchbase:export-ddoc - to export design-documents, stored in your couchbase-cluster, to files
* couchbase:import-ddoc - to import design-documents, saved as file, into your couchbase-bucket
